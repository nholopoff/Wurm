# SERVER MODS #

### AGO SHIT ###
* Server modlauncher 0.34(0.35 beta)
* Announcer ("FAGGOT HAS LOGGED IN" serverwide messages)
* Bag of Holding (Spell that increases the capacity of a container)
* Creature Age Mod (essential for making animal husbandry actually worth the time on /v/servers) (discuss settings)
* CropMod
* HarvestHelper (please, nobody does any transmutation because of the season shit)
* InbreedWarning (Spiderman thread?)
* HTTPServer & ScriptRunner (if GM needs it)
* SpellMod (MANUALLY CONFIGURE THE PROPERTIES) (enable unlimitedPrayers, keep everything else false)
*Maybe server maps?*

### BDEW SHIT ###
* Bind To All Interfaces (if using containers/VMs to run the server, docker ect.)
* Action Timer Fix (timerfixes)
* BETTER DIGGING (Default settings)
* BETTER FARMING (Default settings) //makes leveling farming actually worthwhile, mushroom planting may be op
*(if laggy server, try no fog spiders mod)*
* Hitching limits (remove the weird age requirements for carting hell horses and unicorns, or hitching atypical creatures like rats)
* Fix Guards and set height (GM command)
* Taxidermy
* Move to Center
* Bulk Transport Mod (removes limit of moving items from BSB ex. typing 1000 won't give you an error anymore)

### ULVIRALA SHIT ###
* Epic Mission Hints (So we actually do Valrei shit, disable the epic structures holy shit they suck)
* No mail cost (might as well since we never use it)
*Pvp surface mining slope (should only be for Epic, but use it in case slopes are fucked anyway)*
* Ash Produce (cleaning helps but it needs to burn 30 minutes for ANY ash)
* Fire burn time (tells you the exact time)
* Double bulk capacity (why not?)
* Pick more sprouts (to compensate for the faggots who don't pick sprouts)
* Better Gamemaster (remove if buggy)
* More Potables (gives cooks more choices in herbs and spices, or can grow atypical shit like mixed grasses or longswords)
*HAVE TO ADD EACH ITEM INDIVIDUALLY*

### WALKERINTHEVOID SHIT ###
* BoatMod (Configure how wind affects boats, animals swim when led with rope)
* BountyMod
* BulkMod (all it does is let you add hot items to BSBs)
* MeditateMod (Remove 5 skill gain a day, remove changing path delay and reduce time for questions)
* Salve Mod (healing cover sorted by power first)
*Sacrifice Mod (saccing animals gives a chance to give a bone that gives an item rarity, can be too OP)*

### SINDUSK SHIT ###
* Sindusk Library PREREQ FOR ALL SINDUSK MODS
* Armory (Configure the weapons, I suggest keeping everything vanilla except removing CR penalties on weapons)
* Server Player Counter (correct number of players displayed, suck it "let it die"
* Server Tweaks (disable fatigue)
*Discord Relay (Don't add this, just let the discfags know it exists to fuck with them)*
*Spellcraft can be fun but requires a lot of adjustments to maintain balance*

### AUSIMUS SHIT ###
* Modify Gestation Time (combine with creature age to make animal husbandry worth a damn)

### GOVERNOR SHIT ###
* Wyvern Anti Cheat (may hide players, hides hidden ores from livemap which made prospecting worthless)
*PERFORMANCE ISSUES (try disabling the player feature, disable mod entirely if that doesn't work)*
* Location Command Mod (adds coordinate information with /location command)
##### Add these for better PMK options: #####
* Add Kingdom Items Mod (add pmk shit from WO, have a crusader wagon and so on)
* Tabard Mod (same shit as above but with tabards, no idea if they are redundant)

### NEKOEXMACHINA SHIT ###
*Spellpower (removes possibility of shattering items with enchants depending on QL vs channeling skill)*
*	(ex. channeling skill of 1 means 99+ql won't shatter, 2 means 98+ won't shatter...)*
*	(May be unbalanced)*

### DRUWARD SHIT ###
* HOTA Statues (can make those dope statues)

### ABSOLUTELYNOBODY SHIT ###
* Creatures Mods (let's get this one working on a test server before, also determine if it works with bounty mod)

### XYP SHIT ###
* New Portals (for GM)

### GENSEKIAL SHIT ###
* Accelerated Forestry & Gardening Mod (counteract the short lifespan of our servers)
